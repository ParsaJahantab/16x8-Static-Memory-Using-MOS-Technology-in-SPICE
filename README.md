## üõ†Ô∏è Project Components

### 1. **Custom Logic Gates**
   - **4-input NAND Gate**: Built using MOS transistors to perform NAND operations with 4 inputs.
   - **2-input NAND Gate**: A simplified version of the NAND gate with 2 inputs.
   - **Inverter Gate**: Basic inverter logic using MOSFETs to invert the input signal.
   - **4-input AND Gate**: Created from multiple NAND gates and inverters, forming a logical AND operation with 4 inputs.

### 2. **Decoder**
   - The **decoder** is constructed using the previously designed gates to select the correct memory address in the 16x8 memory array.

### 3. **6T SRAM Cells**
   - Each row contains **8 SRAM cells**. The cells are connected to both ground and VDD to store data reliably.

### 4. **Tri-State Buffers**
   - **Tri-state buffers** are used to control data flow into and out of the memory cells, ensuring data is read/written only to the selected memory address.

### 5. **Voltage Buffers**
   - Buffers are incorporated to maintain voltage levels above **90% of VDD**, preventing any drop that could lead to data corruption or incorrect memory operation.

### 6. **Optimization for Area, Power, and Delay**
   - **Area**: Efficient layout of transistors to minimize the physical space used.
   - **Power**: Reduced power consumption by optimizing the gate design and minimizing leakage.
   - **Delay**: Fast access times achieved by reducing propagation delay through careful gate design.
